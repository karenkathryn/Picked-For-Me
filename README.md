# Picked For Me

This README.md file will serve as a roadmap to this repository. The repository is open and available to the public.

Directories and files to be aware of:

1. An “environment.yml” file that contains the packages necessary to running the executables.
2. An src/ directory that contains a .py module.
    - In the root directory of this folder on your local machine, in your terminal please run 'pip install -e .' to allow the notebooks to access our functions. This will run our 'setup.py' file in the root directory.
3. A notebooks/ directory that contains two Jupyter notebooks: a. A data exploration notebook (EDA_and_data_reduction) b. A modeling notebook (implementation)
4. A data/ directory containing four data files a. Due to GitHub upload restrictions, these are included as .gitignore files. They are, in brief:   
    - The word2vec model 
    - The TF-IDF model 
    - The cosine similarity matrix 
    - The recipe data
